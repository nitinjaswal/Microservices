Why DTO - We need some way to abstract our internal data with external data
- Exposing data models is not good for privacy, 
- Contractual coupling: If there is any change in model , client may get affected
- We put data on DTO , which we want to expose to consumer

Automaper is used to map DTOs with models
-No need to define mapping while creating profile if properties are same
